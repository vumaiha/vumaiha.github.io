						I am an Assistant Professor, Teaching Stream at University of Toronto Mississauga, affiliated with the Departments of <a href="https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/language-studies/">Language Studies</a> and <a href="https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/math-cs-stats/">Mathematics, Computer Science, and Statistics</a>. 
					</p>
					<p>
					I deeply love planning courses and teaching undergraduate students. In the past, I have taught many courses <a href="teaching.html">in Linguistics</a>, and I am very excited to expand more into teaching Computer Science and Computational Linguistics. I am in particular passionate about bridging the gap between linguistic and computational knowledge: both making technical skills accessible to students without a technical background and establishing the importance of theoretical foundations to technically minded students. 
					</p>
					<p>
						My main research interests lie in the intersection of Theoretical Linguistics, Computational/Mathematical
						Linguistics, and Typology. I use computational methods, most notably tools from formal language
						theory,
						in order to gain a better understanding of possible human language patterns. I believe in
						studying
						language as a computed output of the human cognitive faculty, and that typological data provides
						a
						key
						for measuring the computational capacity of human cognition.</p>
<p>
						More recently, I have also become
						interested in studying currently popular deep neural network-based models of language,
						particularly
						in
						applying a linguistic perspective to better understand their inner workings both for modelling
						linguistic and non-linguistic data, and to build improved models that are appropriate for even
						non-linguistic, sequential data.</p>
					<p>
						My work is interdisciplinary at its core, and I have been involved with a very diverse set of
						research
						topics, ranging from all subfields of theoretical linguistics and using a variety of
						computational
						and
						mathematical tools. You can see more details about my research projects under <a
							href="research.html">Projects</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						In my free time, I love tinkering with my website and my LaTeX files, and I am happy to help
						anyone
						who
						has LaTeX questions. See <a href="latex.html">LaTeX</a> for some useful links. To learn about
						other
						non-academic related interests, my <a href="links.html">favorite links</a> should give you some
						idea.
