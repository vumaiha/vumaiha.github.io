<h2>
About
</h2>
<p>
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at University of Oslo. I am involved with the <a href="https://www.uio.no/english/research/strategic-research-areas/life-science/research/convergence-environments/immunolingo/">Immunolingo Project</a>, an exciting interdisciplinary collaboration between immunology, machine learning, statistics, and linguistics. My PI is <a href="https://www.hf.uio.no/ifikk/english/people/aca/classics/tenured/daghaug/index.html">Dag Haug</a>.
</p>
<p>
I have received my PhD in Linguistics from University of Delaware in 2020. My main interests are Syntax, Typology, and Computational/Mathematical Linguistics. My narrower interests revolve around negation, the typology of NPI-licensing, and using computational and mathematical approaches to model linguistic structures. You can see more details about my research projects under <a href="research.html">Research</a>.
</p>
<p>
In my free time, I love tinkering with my website and my LaTeX files, and I am happy to help anyone who has LaTeX questions. See <a href="latex.html">LaTeX</a> for some useful links. To learn about other non-academic related interests, my <a href="links.html">favorite links</a> should give you some idea.

<h2>
My name
</h2>
<p>
<b>In short:</b> Call me <b>Mai Ha</b>. Pronounce it as: [maɪ ha]. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Extra info:</b> I have a Vietnamese name. Vu is my surname (the name I inherited from my father). Mai Ha are my two given names. In Vietnam, people would call me either Mai Ha or Ha, but I prefer Mai Ha. If you are curious, this is the full Vietnamese version of my name, with tones: Vũ Mai Hà.
