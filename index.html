						I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at University of Oslo. I am involved with the <a
							href="https://www.uio.no/english/research/strategic-research-areas/life-science/research/convergence-environments/immunolingo/">Immunolingo
							Project</a>, an exciting interdisciplinary collaboration between immunology, machine
						learning,

						My main interests lie in the intersection Theoretical Linguistics, Computational/Mathematical
						Linguistics, and Typology. I use computational methods, most notably tools from formal language
						theory,
						in order to gain a better understanding of possible human language patterns. I believe in
						studying
						language as a computed output of the human cognitive faculty, and that typological data provides
						a
						key
						for measuring the computational capacity of human cognition. More recently, I have also become
						interested in studying currently popular deep neural network-based models of language,
						particularly
						in
						applying a linguistic perspective to better understand their inner workings both for modelling
						linguistic and non-linguistic data, and to build improved models that are appropriate for even
						non-linguistic, sequential data.
						My work is interdisciplinary at its core, and I have been involved with a very diverse set of
						research
						topics, ranging from all subfields of theoretical linguistics and using a variety of
						computational
						and
						mathematical tools. You can see more details about my research projects under <a
							href="research.html">Research</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						In my free time, I love tinkering with my website and my LaTeX files, and I am happy to help
						anyone
						who
						has LaTeX questions. See <a href="latex.html">LaTeX</a> for some useful links. To learn about
						other
						non-academic related interests, my <a href="links.html">favorite links</a> should give you some
						idea.

						<b>Extra info:</b> I have a Vietnamese name. Vu is my surname (the name I inherited from my

						Mai
