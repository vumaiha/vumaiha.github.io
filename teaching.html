<u>Formal Language Theory in Linguistics</u> (LING 4170)
<br>
<i>Instructor</i>: 2021 Fall (<a href="syllabi/uio-ling4170-21F-syllabus.pdf">Syllabus</a>)

<br>
<p>
This course aims to teach students about the Chomsky Hierarchy and its application to natural language. It is a course for helping linguistics students understand natural language as something computable, describable in mathematical and computational terms; and place natural language grammars within the broader set of all possible grammars. The course covers regular languages and context-free languages in depth, and also introduces subregular languages. We will also read artificial language learning experiments that are informed by this perspective. In the end of the course, students should have a good understanding about the various formalisms used in formal language theory (grammars, automata, logic) and be able to read and understand primary sources on the topic. In addition to the readings list, students will choose one article for their syllabus. More information on this will be given when the course starts.

<u>Language, Mind and Society</u> (LING/CGSC 102)
<br>

<i>Instructor</i>: 2016 Spring (<a href="syllabi/LING102-16S-syllabus.pdf">Syllabus</a>)

<br>
<p>
Explores the interrelation between language, mind and society. Topics will vary depending on instructor, but may include: origins of language, impact of culture on language and thought, structural aspects of language variation and the mental representation of language, role of universal grammar in language learning, regional and social variation in language, sociolinguistics of multilingual/multiethnic communities, language change, and the role of language in social and political decision making.

<u>Science of Language</u> (LING 202)
<br>
<i>Instructor</i>: 2016 Winter (<a href="syllabi/LING202-16W-syllabus.pdf">Syllabus</a>)
<br>
<p>
Extension of the study of linguistics begun in LING101. The focus is on formal, scientific aspects of linguistics, specifically articulatory phonetics and the IPA transcription system, phonology, morphology and syntax. The course examines linguistic phenomena in English as well as other languages. PREREQ: LING101.

<u>Language and Gender</u> (LING/WOMS 222)
<br>
<i>Instructor</i>: 2017 Spring (<a href="syllabi/LING222-17S-syllabus.pdf">Syllabus</a>)
<br>
<p>
This course explores the interaction between gender, language, and social structure. We will conduct critical investigation in the ways the production and perception of language reflects and perpetuates differences in gender identity and sexual orientation, and the potential in language to challenge and transform perceptions of gender and gender relations. We will also learn about how intersecting identities can further affect the relationship between gender and language. Both individual and social implications will be emphasized.

By the end of the course, students will have developed critical reading and reasoning skills when consuming social science articles. They also will be able to notice how language and gender interacts in their everyday life, and give a well-informed, critical analysis of their observations.
