The first result of this analysis shows that the GEN function is not definable in Monadic Second Order (MSO) logic. Second, we show that the set of input-output Correspondence-theoretic candidates from a given underlying representation is definable in First Order (FO) logic, which is less complex than MSO-logic. Third, we present some case studies where the correct input-output Correspondence-theoretic candidate from a given underlying representation can be accomplished with FO-definable, language-specific, inviolable constraints without recourse to optimization.},

ABSTRACT={This paper shows how methods from statistical relational learning can be used to address problems in grammatical inference using model-theoretic representations of strings. These model-theoretic representations are the basis of representing formal languages logically. Conventional representations include a binary relation for order, and unary relations describing mutually exclusive properties of each position of the string. This paper presents experiments on the learning of formal languages, and their stochastic counterparts, with unconventional models, which relax the mutual exclusivity condition. Unconventional models are motivated by domain-specific knowledge. Comparison of Markov Logic Networks based on both conventional and unconventional word models shows that in the domains of phonology and robotic planning and control Markov Logic Networks with unconventional models achieve better performance and less runtime with smaller networks.}
