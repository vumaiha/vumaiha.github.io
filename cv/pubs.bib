The first result of this analysis shows that the GEN function is not definable in Monadic Second Order (MSO) logic. Second, we show that the set of input-output Correspondence-theoretic candidates from a given underlying representation is definable in First Order (FO) logic, which is less complex than MSO-logic. Third, we present some case studies where the correct input-output Correspondence-theoretic candidate from a given underlying representation can be accomplished with FO-definable, language-specific, inviolable constraints without recourse to optimization.},

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is a key technology for accurate prediction of antibody-antigen binding. Two orthogonal problems hinder the application of ML to antibody-specificity prediction and the benchmarking thereof: The lack of a unified ML formalization of immunological antibody specificity prediction problems and the unavailability of large-scale synthetic benchmarking datasets of real-world relevance. Here, we developed the Absolut! software suite that enables parameter-based unconstrained generation of synthetic lattice-based 3D-antibody-antigen binding structures with ground-truth access to conformational paratope, epitope, and affinity. We formalized common immunological antibody specificity prediction problems as ML tasks and confirmed that for both sequence and structure-based tasks, accuracy-based rankings of ML methods trained on experimental data hold for ML methods trained on Absolut!-generated data. The Absolut! framework thus enables real-world relevant development and benchmarking of ML strategies for biotherapeutics design.The software framework Absolut! enables (A,B) the generation of virtually arbitrarily large numbers of synthetic 3D-antibody-antigen structures, (C,D) the formalization of antibody specificity as machine learning (ML) tasks as well as the exploration of ML strategies for real-world antibody-antigen binding or paratope-epitope prediction.Graphical abstract HighlightsSoftware framework Absolut! to generate an arbitrarily large number of synthetic 3D-antibody-antigen structures that contain biological layers of antibody-antigen binding complexity that render ML predictions challengingImmunological antibody specificity prediction problems formalized as machine learning tasks for which the in silico complexes are immediately usable as benchmark datasetsExploration of machine learning prediction accuracy as a function of architecture, dataset size, choice of negatives, and sequence-structure encodingRelative ML performance learnt on Absolut! datasets transfers to experimental datasetsCompeting Interest StatementE.M. declares holding shares in aiNET GmbH.

  abstract = {Deep neural-network-based language models (LMs) are increasingly applied to large-scale protein sequence data to predict protein function. However, being largely black-box models and thus challenging to interpret, current protein LM approaches do not contribute to a fundamental understanding of sequence–function mappings, hindering rule-based biotherapeutic drug development. We argue that guidance drawn from linguistics, a field specialized in analytical rule extraction from natural language data, can aid with building more interpretable protein LMs that are more likely to learn relevant domain-specific rules. Differences between protein sequence data and linguistic sequence data require the integration of more domain-specific knowledge in protein LMs compared with natural language LMs. Here, we provide a linguistics-based roadmap for protein LM pipeline choices with regard to training data, tokenization, token embedding, sequence embedding and model interpretation. Incorporating linguistic ideas into protein LMs enables the development of next-generation interpretable machine learning models with the potential of uncovering the biological mechanisms underlying sequence–function relationships.},

ABSTRACT={This paper shows how methods from statistical relational learning can be used to address problems in grammatical inference using model-theoretic representations of strings. These model-theoretic representations are the basis of representing formal languages logically. Conventional representations include a binary relation for order, and unary relations describing mutually exclusive properties of each position of the string. This paper presents experiments on the learning of formal languages, and their stochastic counterparts, with unconventional models, which relax the mutual exclusivity condition. Unconventional models are motivated by domain-specific knowledge. Comparison of Markov Logic Networks based on both conventional and unconventional word models shows that in the domains of phonology and robotic planning and control Markov Logic Networks with unconventional models achieve better performance and less runtime with smaller networks.}
